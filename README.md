# Frisör-Atelje

Frisör Ateljé is a freelance one-page web app. The design and look of the website are the most important parts, but I hope my auto-scroll function on the menu or implementation of Google Maps will help someone.

## Features:

1. **Design Focus:** The website emphasizes a visually appealing design and aesthetic, making it an attractive showcase for freelancers.

2. **Auto-scroll Functionality:** Implemented auto-scroll function on the menu for enhanced user experience and navigation efficiency.

3. **Google Maps Integration:** Integrated Google Maps for location-based information, potentially aiding visitors in finding the physical location of the business.

## Technologies Used:

- **HTML5:** Utilized for structuring the content of the web page.
   
- **Tailwind CSS:** Employed for styling and layout purposes, focusing on creating an engaging visual experience with the Tailwind CSS framework.

- **JavaScript:** Used for implementing interactivity, including the auto-scroll feature.

- **Next.js:** Employed for building dynamic components and enhancing performance with Next.js. I chose Next for this project for SSR.

- **Google Maps API:** Integrated for displaying location-based information.

- **Shadcn/UI:** Utilized for UI components and styling, potentially enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.
